# Power Query Script for `kpi_data`

## Overview
This Power Query script processes a KPI dataset from an Excel file, transforming and preparing the data for analysis. The script extracts fiscal year and quarter information from a `Date` column and ensures proper data typing for downstream usage in Power BI.

## Key Steps
1. **Source Data**:
   - Reads the data from an Excel file. Replace `"INSERT FILE PATH HERE"` with the actual file path.
   - Promotes the first row to headers.

2. **Data Type Transformation**:
   - Converts columns to their appropriate types:
     - `Indicator`: Text
     - `Client group`: Text
     - `Value`: Integer
     - `Date`: Text

3. **Extract Fiscal Year (`FisYear`)**:
   - Adds a `FisYear` column by extracting the first 4 characters from the `Date` column (assumed to represent the year).

4. **Extract Quarter (`Quarter`)**:
   - Adds a `Quarter` column by extracting the last character from the `Date` column (assumed to represent the quarter).

5. **Rename and Finalise**:
   - Renames the `Custom` column to `FisYear`.
   - Ensures correct data types for `FisYear` and `Quarter`.

## Requirements
- **Input Data**:
  - An Excel file with a sheet named `Sheet1`.
  - Columns:
    - `Indicator`: KPI name
    - `Client group`: Group being measured
    - `Value`: Numeric value of the KPI
    - `Date`: A string in `YYYYQ` format (e.g., `2023Q1`).

- **Output Data**:
  - Adds two new columns:
    - `FisYear`: Extracted fiscal year as an integer.
    - `Quarter`: Extracted quarter as an integer.

## Usage
1. Replace `"INSERT FILE PATH HERE"` with the full file path to your Excel dataset.
2. Load the script into Power Query in Power BI or Excel.
3. Ensure the input data matches the required format (e.g., `Date` column with `YYYYQ` values).
4. Use the transformed dataset for further analysis, including visualisation or KPI calculations.

---

### Notes
- Ensure the `Date` column is in `YYYYQ` format before using this script.
- Modify column names or data types in the script if your dataset's structure is different.



# ComparisonType Table

## Overview
The `ComparisonType` table is a static DAX-created table in Power BI. It defines the options available for selecting a comparison type when analysing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

## Structure
- **Column**: `ComparisonType` (string)
- **Values**:
  1. `Previous Quarter Same Year`: Compares the latest quarter's KPI value to the previous quarter within the same year.
  2. `Previous Year Same Quarter`: Compares the latest quarter's KPI value to the same quarter in the previous year.

## Usage
- Use this table as a slicer in your Power BI reports to allow users to select the desired comparison type.
- The selection drives dynamic measures (e.g., `FIN_SlicerCompare`) to calculate and display performance trends based on the chosen comparison type.

## Code
The table is created using the following DAX code:

```DAX
ComparisonType = DATATABLE(
    "ComparisonType", STRING,
    {
        {"Previous Quarter Same Year"},
        {"Previous Year Same Quarter"}
    }
)
